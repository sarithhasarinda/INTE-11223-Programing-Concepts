#This is homework 1

1. Design an algorithm and the corresponding flowchart for finding the sum of the numbers 2,
4, 6, 8, â€¦, n
2. Using flowchart, design an algorithm to read 100 numbers and then display the sum.
3. Using flowcharts, design an algorithm to read two numbers then display the largest.
4. Using flowchart, design an algorithm to read two numbers then display the smallest
5. Using flowcharts, design an algorithm to read three numbers then display the largest.
6. Using flowchart, design an algorithm to read 100 numbers then display the largest.
7. Draw a flowchart for a program that will input a list of N test scores (test score >= 0) and
finds the highest test score and finds the number of the students whose score is 50 or
above
8. Draw a flowchart for a program which reads (inputs) a positive integer N and calculates
the sum:
9. Draw a flowchart to display all odd numbers between 0 and 1000.
10. Draw a flowchart to display the sum of all even numbers between 0 and 100
11. Draw a flowchart to display all prime number between 1 and 100.
12. Fred sells bunches of flowers at the local shopping centre. One day Fred's boss, Joe, tells
Fred that at any time during the day he (Joe) will need to know:
o how many bunches of flowers have been sold
o what was the value of the most expensive bunch sold
o what was the value of the least expensive bunch sold
o what is the average value of bunches sold
13. With your answer for question 12 modify the flow chart so that it has a main flow chart
and shows each of the following as sub-process flow charts:
o the initialization of the variables
o the process or processes for calculating how many bunches of flowers have been
sold
o the process or processes for calculating what was the value of the most expensive
bunch sold
o the process or processes for calculating what was the value of the least expensive
bunch sold
o the process or processes for calculating what is the average value of bunches sold
o the display of all the results
