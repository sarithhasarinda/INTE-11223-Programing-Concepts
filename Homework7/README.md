1. Consider a 2-by-5 integer array t.

  a) Write a definition for t.
  
  b) How many rows does t have?
  
  c) How many columns does t have?
 
  d) How many elements does t have?
  
  e) Write the names of all the elements in the second row of t.
  
  f) Write the names of all the elements in the third column of t.
  
  g) Write a single statement that sets the element of t in row 1 and column 2 to zero.
  
  h) Write a nested for statement that initializes each element of t to zero.
  
  i) Write a statement that inputs the values for the elements of t from the terminal.
  
  j) Write a series of statements that determine and print the smallest value in t.
  
  k) Write a statement that displays the elements of the first row of t.
  
  l) Write a statement that totals the elements of the fourth column of t.
  
  m) Write a series of statements that print the array t in tabular format. List the column
  subscripts as headings across the top and list the row subscripts at the left of each
  row.
  
2. Airline Reservations System

  A small airline has just purchased a computer for its new automated reservations
  system. The president has asked you to program the new system. You are to write a
  program to assign seats on each flight of the airline's only plane (capacity: 10 seats).
  Your program should display the following menu of alternatives:
  Please type 1 for "first class"
  Please type 2 for "economy"
  If the person types 1, then your program should assign a seat in the first class section
  (seats 1-5). If the person types 2, then your program should assign a seat in the
  economy section (seats 6-10). Your program should then print a boarding pass
  indicating the person's seat number and whether it is in the first class or economy
  section of the plane.
  Use a single-subscripted array to represent the seating chart of the plane. Initialize all
  the elements of the array to 0 to indicate that all seats are empty. As each seat is
  assigned, set the corresponding elements of the array to 1 to indicate that the seat is no
  longer available. Your program should, of course, never assign a seat that has already
  been assigned. When the first class section is full, your program should ask the person
  if it is acceptable to be placed in the economy section (and vice versa). If yes, then
  make the appropriate seat assignment. If no, then print the message "Next flight leaves
  in 3 hours."
  
3. Write a program that inputs a line of text into char array s[ 100 ]. Output the line in
uppercase letters and in lowercase letters.
