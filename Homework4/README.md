Homework 4
Draw flow charts and write code for following problems.
1. Design a program that reads a value of N and then compute the average of the Next N elements of inputs.
2. Revise your program from question 1 so that now it computes only the average of those input items that are greater than 10.
3. Design a program that reads a value of N and then computes the smallest and the largest numbers in the next N elements of inputs.
4. Design a program that reads a value of N and then computes the THIRD smallest number in the next N elements of inputs.
5. Design a function to compute the greatest common divisor of two integers read from input data.
6. Design a function to compute the smallest common factor of two integers read from input data.
